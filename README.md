# python_outline
Step 1:

    Introduction to Python and basic data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)

    Basic operations (arithmetic, assignment, comparison)
    
    Control structures (if/else, for loops, while loops)

Step 2:

    Lists and dictionaries (indexing, slicing, adding, removing elements)

    Functions (defining, calling, passing arguments, returning values)

Step 3:

    Modules and libraries (importing, using built-in functions)

    File handling (reading, writing, appending)

Step 4:

    Exception handling (try/except)

    Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism)

Step 5:

    Advanced topics (lambda functions, list comprehension, generator expressions, decorators)
    
 
Practice exercises and coding challenges
Note that it is important to practice coding and solve problems while learning. This itinerary can be adjusted based on the time you have and how deep you want to learn the language. Additionally, python has many libraries and application in various domains like web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and many more, so you may want to focus on the specific application you are interested in.
